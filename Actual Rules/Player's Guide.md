# Player’s Guide

Characters are the heart of any story. As a player, you get to immerse yourself in the story through your character. This chapter has everything you need to create your own character, understand how [character journal name]s work, and learn how to play the game.

## Your First Character

So you and your group have decided to play the Adept. Maybe you’re gathering together at the game table for the first session, or you’re making plans online. Regardless of where, when, and how you meet, the most important part of getting started is creating your first character.

## Understanding Your Character

As a player, your interaction with the rules of the Adept starts with your [character journal name]. Everything you need to discover new places, puzzle out intrigues, and enjoy adventures comes from the traits and die ratings you have before you.

In this section, I break down all of these traits and what they mean. You might find yourself referring back to this section a lot when you create your own character and play them for the first time. It’s also a handy reference during the game when deciding which trait to include in your dice pool.

## Approaches

How do you solve the problems in front of you? You draw upon your approaches: **Flair**, **Focus**, **Force**, **Guile**, **Haste**, and **Wits**. Every PC has a rating in these six traits from a lowly d4 to a world-class d12. You always include one of your approaches in your dice pool when you attempt a roll. Which approach you include depends on the circumstances.

Your approach’s die rating doesn’t necessarily mean you are deeply flawed if it’s a d4 or the best in the world if it’s a d12, but it does show that this is a part of your character that has or hasn’t become the focus of your attention, your development, and your story. Most PCs have approach die ratings of d6 and d8, with a d10 in the approach they’re most known for. A d12 approach is rare indeed and often comes at the expense of other parts of the character’s abilities.

> **d4 Underdeveloped**. You don’t use this part of yourself much.
>
> **d6 Average**. You use this from time to time.
> 
> **d8 Notable**. You use this often.
> 
> **d10 Significant**. You use this almost all the time.
> 
> **d12 Superlative**. You have reached your absolute peak with this.

### Flair

Actions that draw attention to you beaming with style and panache use **Flair**.

- Use this when you are delivering speeches, or performing flashy magic.
- A character with a low **Flair** is often quiet, or bleak.
- A character with a high **Flair** is often loud, bright, and flashy.

### Focus

Time-consuming actions, close attention to details, and precision use **Focus**.

- Use this if you are standing on guard brewing potions and casting finesse rituals.
- A character with a low **Focus** is often inaccurate, negligent or distracted.
- A character with a high **Focus** is often careful, precise, and attentive.

### Force

Displays of brute and unrestricted strength use **Force**.

- Use this when you are wrestling, or blasting off with spells. 
- A character with a low **Force** is often moderate, collected, and reserved.
- A character with a high **Force** is often energetic, strong, or volatile.

### Guile

Misdirection, subterfuge, deception and stelth use **Guile**.

- Use this to pickpocket, sneak around, or talk your way out.
- A character with a low **Guile** is often innocent, overt, and straightforward. 
- A character with a high **Guile** is often cunning, deceptive, and sneaky.

### Haste

- A character with a low **Haste** is often slow, clumsy, or lagging.

### Wits

Quick thinking, complex problemsolving, and accounting for multiple shifting variables all at once use **Wits**.

- Use this to outwitt all sorts of alien creatures, craft new spells, and conduct nuanced research.
- A character with a low **Wits** is often simpleminded, irrational, or dull.
- A character with a high **Wits** is often clever, learned, and sharp-witted.

## Values

You’re about to start your adventures in a world of mythical antiquity, so you need to know what matters to you and why you do what you do — this is represented by your values: **Devotion**, **Glory**, **Justice**, **Liberty**, **Mastery**, and **Truth**. Every character’s investment in these six traits runs from a barely interested d4 to a supremely committed d12. The bigger the die rating, the more that value helps you.

You always include one of your values in your dice pool when you’re attempting a roll; which one depends on what motivates your character in each situation.

Each value has a value statement attached to it, which describes how your character thinks or feels about that value. You can use your value statement to help you roleplay your character and make choices about how they might act; you can also question your value statement in play, which reflects how people change and grow in their beliefs about the world around them. See Questioning Value Statements for more on questioning your value statement.

Values always have fifteen die steps in total, with a d4 counting as one step; if you step up one value’s die rating, you step down another.

Use the following as a guideline for determining how much each of these values matters to your PC. Remember: value die ratings change a lot during play, so don’t worry if at first it seems like you don’t care much about one of these values.

> d4 Indifferent “This hardly matters to me.”
> 
> d6 Neutral “This matters, but so do many things.”
> 
> d8 Inspired “This is important to me.”
> 
> d10 Invested “This is a major part of my life.”
> 
> d12 Obsessed “This is my heart and soul.”

## Distinctions

Who are you and where do you come from? What do others remember about you? How are you described to others in the tales told of your adventures? You are the grand sum of your distinctions. Every PC starts with three distinctions rated at d8 and players may change them over time. You always include one of your distinctions in your dice pool. Which one you choose may have a part to play in the outcome of your test, contest, or challenge.

Distinctions each belong to one of three broad groups:

- Your character’s upbringing and background
- Your character’s training, calling, and specialisation
- Your character’s most memorable or peculiar quirk or character trait

Distinctions always have the Hinder SFX by default (See Special Effects). Your distinctions should be worded so that they have a potential downside or means of getting in your way, as well as helping you out. A good distinction covers both!

### Upbringing

How were you brought up? Your upbringing distinction reflects where you grew up, what social class and culture you belonged to when you were raised.

For non-sumerians it includes the land you are from.

For ocasional demi-humans it includes more supernatural parts of your heritage.

> #### Example upbringing distinctions
> 
> Half-elven Bastard of Nobility

### High Concept

How do you see yourself? Your high concept distinction represents your vision of yourself, what is your profile knowledge, skills, and your specialty in magic.

> #### Example high concept distinctions
> 
> Scholar, Seeker of Power and Knowledge

### Oddity

What is peculiar about you? Your oddity distinction, more than any other description, best summarises who your PC is in regard to everyone else, especially characters with the same, or similar upbringing and high concept distinctions.

> #### Example oddity distinctions
> 
> Brilliant Mind, Dull Empathy
