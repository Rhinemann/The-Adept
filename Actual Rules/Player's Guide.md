# Player’s Guide

Characters are the heart of any story. As a player, you get to immerse yourself in the story through your character. This chapter has everything you need to create your own character, understand how [character journal name]s work, and learn how to play the game.

## Your First Character

So you and your group have decided to play the Adept. Maybe you’re gathering together at the game table for the first session, or you’re making plans online. Regardless of where, when, and how you meet, the most important part of getting started is creating your first character.

## Understanding Your Character

As a player, your interaction with the rules of the Adept starts with your [character journal name]. Everything you need to discover new places, puzzle out intrigues, and enjoy adventures comes from the traits and die ratings you have before you.

In this section, I break down all of these traits and what they mean. You might find yourself referring back to this section a lot when you create your own character and play them for the first time. It’s also a handy reference during the game when deciding which trait to include in your dice pool.

## Approaches

How do you solve the problems in front of you? You draw upon your approaches: **Flair**, **Focus**, **Force**, **Guile**, **Haste**, and **Wits**. Every PC has a rating in these six traits from a lowly d4 to a world-class d12. You always include one of your approaches in your dice pool when you attempt a roll. Which approach you include depends on the circumstances.

Your approach’s die rating doesn’t necessarily mean you are deeply flawed if it’s a d4 or the best in the world if it’s a d12, but it does show that this is a part of your character that has or hasn’t become the focus of your attention, your development, and your story. Most PCs have approach die ratings of d6 and d8, with a d10 in the approach they’re most known for. A d12 approach is rare indeed and often comes at the expense of other parts of the character’s abilities.

> **d4 Underdeveloped**. You don’t use this part of yourself much.
>
> **d6 Average**. You use this from time to time.
> 
> **d8 Notable**. You use this often.
> 
> **d10 Significant**. You use this almost all the time.
