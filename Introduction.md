# Introduction

There was once a time where magic lived on Earth, gods could, albeit rarely, walk among mortals and ancient monsters and demons that you consider imaginary were real and plagued people around the world. And at that time there was one place that rose among many others - Kengir, or as we know it - Sumer.

The Adept is a game of epic fantasy, where you will play as mašmaš (mages, wizards) of the Tower - individuals so changed and elevated from the commoners you transcend human, as you changed your very soul to be able to work magic.

Among the ranks of masmas of Kengir, status is everything.  Rank affords you resources, renown, royal favour... and, most importantly, access to the Tower's arcane secrets.  Kengir mages do many things: battle monsters threatening the peasantry, uncover nefarious and supernatural plots, quell the unruly spirits of the land, even defend the borders against the lugal's enemies.  But all of this is done in service to the goal of gaining rank and outpacing their rivals in unravelling the secrets of the multiverse.
