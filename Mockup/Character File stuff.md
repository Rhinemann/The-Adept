## SFX

In The Adept SFX can be applied to your Distinctions, Magic as a trait, practice and Status.

## Magic

### Using aether

When you are casting a spell you are assumed to use mana which inflicts Mana stress on hitches. But you may willingly opt to channel another type of aether to fuel your spells from these options: psi, astral body, emosequence and prana. Because you are untrained in using these forms of aether you suffer stress every time you use these, Body stress for prana, Soul stress for astral body and Mind stress for psi and emosequence. As you advance you may acquire access to other forms of aether or become more proficient in channelling some of the aforementioned ones suffering corresponding stress only on hitches.  
Also you can use Magic through another type of aether even when it is shut down by Out of Mana Limit.

### Magic SFX

Your Magic trait has following SFX:
> **Out of Mana**: When Drained stress would step past d12, set it to d12 instead and shut down your Magic, step down Drained to recover. Alternatively you can declare that you are out of mana, shut down your Magic for a scene and gain a PP.  
> **Flexible Casting**: Spend a PP and step down effect die to use your discipline as another practice.

## Hero Dice

Every time you get a heroic success you can store the opposition’s highest rolling die on your character sheet. You can have only one hero die of each size, otherwise they function as stated in the Handbook.

## Stress & Trauma

Stress and trauma are a measure of your damage. There are six types of stress and trauma in the Adept:
Drained: This is the stress of mana depletion. Once this exceeds d12, you are drained of mana and can’t cast even the simplest spell.
- **Exhausted**: This is the stress of fatigue and tiredness. Once this exceeds d12, you can no longer remain awake.
- **Injured**: This is the stress of pain and wounding. Once this exceeds d12, you collapse unconscious, or aren’t able to act because of pain.
- **Rattled**: This is the stress of fear, anxiety and insecurity. Once this exceeds d12, you are paralysed by fear and insecurity.
- **Shattered**: This is the stress of spiritual damage. Once this exceeds d12, your Mantles are shut down and can’t function temporarily.
- **Unsound**: This is the stress of confusion and madness. Once this exceeds d12, you are overcome with madness or confusion.

## Dropping Signature Assets

At any point during the scene a player can choose to lose a Signature Asset narratively justifying it. If you do this, at the start of the next scene you can gain a new Signature Asset of the same size or multiple Signature Assets with ratings stepped down for each after the first.
