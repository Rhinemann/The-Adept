# ASSETS

An asset is a trait you create during play — usually by spending a PP — that instantly labels a part of the fiction as significant. An asset allows you to improve your chance at influencing the story by adding more dice in a flavorful and thematic way. See [Complications](/Complications) for similar traits that make things more difficult instead of easier.

Giving an object a die rating by creating an asset means that this object is a significant part of the story. Most objects in the game are color, setting, or flavor rather than an asset; if it’s something that exists in the story, something the GM or players are using as part of their description, then it should be a part of narrating the outcome of a test or contest, but it doesn’t confer any more dice.

During play, a player can add as many of their fictionally appropriate assets to a dice pool as they’d like. Since they spent a PP to create the asset, there’s no need to spend another to use it.

Assets belong to the character of the player that created them, and by default can’t be included in anyone else’s pool. An asset created to help another character belongs to that character and can’t be used by the creator’s character. Spend an additional PP to declare an asset to be open and usable by any character in the scene, including GMCs.

Assets — also called temporary assets when they need to be distinguished from signature assets — last until the end of the scene, unless something in the story makes them no longer relevant, or they’re stepped down or eliminated.

The player may spend an additional PP to keep the asset around through to the end of the session.

**Spend a PP to:**
- Create a d6 asset
- Make an asset last for the rest of the session
- Declare an asset open to any character in the scene
- Activate a GM opportunity to step up an asset for a scene (sometimes called spotlighting the asset)

## CREATING ASSETS

**There are several ways for players to create assets during play:**
- A player can spend a PP and create a d6 asset with a name they come up with.
- Some SFX allow for stunts—assets that start with a d8 die rating.
- A player can create an asset greater than d6 and without spending a PP by making a test.
- When the narrative situation calls for it, the GM may declare that a d6 asset is created for free as part of a successful test that wasn’t made explicitly to create an asset.

### TEST-CREATED ASSETS

To create an asset by attempting a test, a player declares what their character does to create the asset and assembles an appropriate dice pool. The GM rolls to set the difficulty, usually with something basic like 2d6.

The effect die of the test becomes the die rating of the asset. The GM may set a cap on the size of assets created this way by setting the difficulty dice to that die rating. The asset created may not be larger than this die cap.

### CLUES AS ASSETS
Anytime a PC wants to get a read on somebody, case a scene, spot something out of the ordinary, or generally just use their senses, they’re creating an asset.

The GM usually calls for the roll, though it’s just as valid for a player to ask for it. The difficulty for an asset test is set by rolling a straight 2d6 — unless the GM decides otherwise. A player’s dice pool for the test is assembled from appropriate traits.

With a successful test, the PC gains some crucial information. If the PC spends a PP after succeeding at the test, they can give it to another character, or keep it for longer.

With a failed test, the PC doesn’t gain any useful advantage. If there are complications, they generally represent the consequences of poking around places trying to find stuff out.

## ASSET VS SIGNATURE ASSET

Unlike a regular asset, a signature asset belongs to a PC and is recorded on their character file. It acts like any other trait and gives the player an extra die to include in their dice pools when they can justify their use.

See [Signature Asset](/Signature-Asset) for more.

# BEAT, AS IN STORY BEAT CORE

A beat is the smallest dramatic unit of the story. It doesn’t matter how long or short the activity is, but how simple it is. If a PC spends hours on something that can be easily summed up in a sentence, it’s one beat. If a PC spends thirty seconds escaping, it might be four or five separate beats.

There’s no fixed number of how many beats make up a scene. They’re a convenient way to frame the time it takes a PC to carry out a single test and alter or affect the progress of the story.

Thinking in terms of beats should give the GM a gut sense of the tests a player needs to make to do what they want to do.

See **Test** for using story beats as a countdown in a timed test.

# CHARACTER FILE

A character file is the central record of essential game details for a character. All players maintain their own character file and the GM maintains (often abbreviated) files for important GMCs. Character files change throughout the game, so it’s important to be able to take notes on them.

A character file includes space for all of the information players need to record and maintain, such as the different trait sets and their ratings, signature assets, and other important game statistics.

# COMPLICATIONS

A complication is an unhelpful temporary trait that the opposition includes in their dice pool to make the opposed roll harder for the character with the complication. Complications should be given descriptive names and a die rating, usually a d6 to start.

## CREATING COMPLICATIONS

When a player rolls a hitch (a 1) on any of their dice, the GM can hand over a PP to create a complication. This doesn’t affect the success or failure of the roll—a complication means something else has gone wrong, making life difficult.

Complications start at d6, and additional hitches in the same roll step up the complication without the GM giving the player more PP. The GM may choose to create multiple complications if there is more than one hitch, but each new complication requires handing over a PP. If the player rolls a botch, the GM creates a d6 complication without giving the player a PP, and steps it up for each hitch past the first.

Complications are persistent and last until either the PC has recovered from them, or the complication is made irrelevant.

### WORSENING COMPLICATIONS

Whenever a player or the GM has the option to give a character a complication, they can instead choose to step up an existing complication, making it worse for the affected character.

Generally, only one complication applies to a specific hindrance or problem. To make a complication worse, it should be stepped up.

## USING COMPLICATIONS

Whenever a player or the GM is rolling against a character that has a relevant complication, they may add it to their dice pool. Doing so doesn’t cost anything, and there’s no limit to how many applicable complications can be included in a dice pool, nor is there a limit on how many complications a character can have.

## RECOVERING COMPLICATIONS

Many complications are temporary problems that will go away before the next scene begins. Complications that represent major consequences, however, stick around. To get rid of them, PCs must test their traits to recover.

Getting rid of or reducing a complication is a test vs a dice pool consisting of the complication and a base difficulty of 2d8. The GM may rule that other traits affect the roll, similar to a standard test. Narratively, to make a roll the PC attempting the test and the circumstances surrounding it must be capable of improving the situation.

When the test is complete, one of the following happens:
- If the PC beat the difficulty and the effect die is greater than the complication, the complication is eliminated.
- If the PC beat the difficulty and the effect die is equal to or smaller than the complication, the complication is stepped down by one. Time must pass before another test can be made to recover the complication.
- If the PC failed to beat the difficulty, the complication remains as it is.
- If the PC beat the difficulty but rolled a hitch, the GM may hand over a PP and introduce a new complication related to the one that was just recovered.
- If the PC failed to beat the difficulty and rolled a hitch, the complication is stepped up by one step for every hitch rolled.

## STEPPING COMPLICATIONS UP AND DOWN

Complications attached to a character can be stepped up or down throughout play.

Existing complications may be be stepped up:
- For each hitch in a single roll beyond the hitch used to create the d6 complication
- Instead of creating a new complication
- When a hitch is rolled on a recovery test
- When an SFX instructs you to do so

When a d12 complication needs to be stepped up, the character is taken out of the scene until the complication is removed or no longer hinders them. The player may overcome this for a single test or contest by spending a PP, but may only keep one die for the total instead of two.

See also [Taken Out](/Taken-Out).

Existing complications may be stepped down:
- With a successful recovery test
- By spending a PP to activate an opportunity
- For each additional opportunity in a single roll
- When an SFX instructs you to do so

If a complication is stepped down to d4, it dissapeares instead.

# CONSENT

Every group playing Cortex Prime brings their unique ideas and experiences to the table, which is one of the reasons why tabletop roleplaying can be so full of excitement and surprise. While one goal of the game is to create a story together, an equal part is to create a fun experience for everyone involved.

Consent should form a part of the group’s conversation about social standards at the table, whether playing with old friends, new players, or strangers at a convention. For example, some players aren’t comfortable with characters having the ability to control other characters, especially player characters, with their mind or with mystic spells or possession.

Safety tools can help ensure that your table stays a safe, welcoming, and enjoyable space for you and your players. Introduce a safety tool before beginning your game. There are many tools to choose from, so work with your group to discover which tools you will all find most empowering to use. Safety tools can also be mixed and matched to best serve your group of friends.
