# The Setting

>### A note for GMs  
>The Adept is set in the alternate version of the ancient history of our world, it isn’t too historically accurate and doesn’t try too hard to be such, thus I advise you don’t worry too much about historical accuracy and periodisation if it spoils your fun.

## Magic

Magic, or as it is also called - emeĝar, or the Art. Magic is the power to control mana, chi, shipru or whatever you want to call it. It is Art, Chaos, and Science: a blessing, a curse, and progress. It is “the Art'' as it takes a certain spark, talent and creativity to wield and express it. It is “Chaos” as the magic can be fickle, dangerous and unfathomable by those whose minds are not strong enough to contain it. And it is “Science” for it takes effort, discipline, hard work and extensive study of the very laws that govern the multiverse.  
To use emeĝar on the basic level you need to consume, transform and utilise the mana you received with a part of your soul known as the “Active spirit” or the “Seventh Mantle”. And theoretically magic is simple, you can use it with just your will and imagination to transform mana into whatever you desire, but wizards have been complicating it for better results. So wizards have what is called niĝdimdima (magical procedures): incredibly difficult spells, carefully orchestrated rituals and such. The paradox is that the easier it is for most of the students to learn, it is intricate, but easier to perceive. That is because the Seventh Mantle is dormant in humans, so awakening it requires truly incredible finessing.

## Multiverse

The Multiverse is the common title of all the worlds that were spawned at the time of Creation. It is twelve dimensional and is made of three elements: matter, energy and aether and is governed by the laws that differ from reality to reality.  
A singular world is usually a four-dimensional hypersphere. This hypersphere is usually divided into the seven planes called the Seven Spheres.  
If we look at them inwards from the outside, they go like this:
- **Noosphere** - it is a global informational field of the world which has all the information to ever exist on a given world, nothing exists there except for pure data.
- **The Dreamspace** - this is a plane where the dreamings (an even less real variety of spirits) reside, they can’t enter the material plane, but visit souls and minds of the living quite often, the aether is present, albeit very thinned.
- **The Beyond** - spirit world, the Beyond, this is where mortal souls dwell after their death before being assigned an afterlife, if they qualify, consists purely of aether.
- **The Astral plane** - a plethora of ethereal reflections of a Material plane, such as the mirror realm, the shadow realm, elemental planes and much more, this is where the most spirits reside, mages who can enter ethereal form use this Sphere for fast travel, this plane is made up of aether as well, but much denser kind.
- **Material plane** - classic space you inhabit.
- **Hyperspace** - a plane where euclidean geometry starts to lose its meaning, it is inhabited by cosmic monsters who live beyond the stars, this plane is used for interstellar and cosmic travel, more often by technologically advanced civilisations than magical ones, it is even more real than classic space.
- **The Core** - this is a presumably supermassive and incredibly real object at the centre of one reality, which locks and holds a given reality together, somewhat like the Sun does with the solar system.

Everything that is above the Material plane on the list is called subspace, it is much bigger than classic space, which allows a crafty mage to fit a palace in a box, for example. Hyperspace, on the other hand, is much smaller, thus shortening cosmic distances.  
It Is important to note that everything mentioned above is an average situation, there are much more unorthodox worlds in the multiverse, than the Seven Spheres.  
Other eight dimensions ensure multiplicity of worlds, as all realities are shifted by one step away from each other. Thus you have two to the power of eight directions to travel.  
The space between worlds is filled with shapeless, uncreated Chaos, from which gods build new worlds. The membrane between Chaos and realities is called Limbo.

## Aether

Apart from matter and energy, the multiverse has a third component - spirit. Also named aether.  
Aether is an incorporeal omnipresent substance, that surrounds everything in existence.  
Aether isn’t homogenous. In its natural state it is akin to “astral vacuum”, static and inert. But in the infinite ocean of aether exist streams, winds and waves.The smallest possible part of free aether - somewhat an equivalent of an elementary particle - is called “eon”. And these “spiritual particles” too can exist in different states.  
Here are the most common states of aether:
- Mana or shipru - so called “hot” aether, its accelerated eons flow stream in calm ocean of normal “cold” aether. In its basic form mana is inert and inactive, but holds incredible potential when consumed and utilised in the process known as magic.
- Astral body - stable and dense form of aether, which took a certain shape. This category, for example, includes souls, although they have a very complex structure. There are many worlds composed purely of stable aether -  called astral worlds populated by spirits, matter can’t even exist there. Besides souls of animate beings and astral worlds, every material object has a so-called “astral shadow”, which is similar to an aura of a living being, but much more simple. This shadow is what grands materials and items their magical properties. Because of it silver kills the undead, iron interferes with simple magic and copper can touch incorporeal entities and so forth.
- Prana - “soft” aether, carrying constant and steady flow. This is a life force universal for all beings. If something appears living but doesn't have prana - you are dealing with undead.
- Ba-hion - aether of the highest purification, emanating from the high-level astral body. Divine energy released in any spiritual action. If the action is addressed to a god - a prayer, sacrifice, ministration, even just invocation - the ba-hion goes to this god. The more often and more earnestly the ba-hion is produced, the more valuable such a "battery" is for a given god. But with true magic, the ba-hion is produced much more intensely. It inevitably accompanies any niĝdimdima, even the simplest acts of magic. This is why gods and demons alike value mage worshipers much more than mere mortals.
- Prima element - incredibly potent unidirectional stream of aether. Depending on the direction it may be Light (radiance, altruism and creation) or Darkness (absorption, egoism and destruction) these are not extensions of moral morals, but multiversal constant that constitute the most basic cornerstones of the multiverse, for example: the Core of any given world or Ātman of any being is a balance of both the Light and the Darkness.
- Psi - very “lightweight” form of aether produced by Freneses of sentient beings during cognitive process. Psi is required for any creature to retain its sentience and consciousness.
- Emosequence - reactive and “charged” form of aether produced by emotions of beings with Oumos. Emosequence sustains feelings and personality of an individual. 

## Aetherial Percepcion

All wizards, as well as some other people and magical creatures, have a unique sense called Aetherial Perception, which allows them to perceive aetherial winds, auras and other such things. But there is no special organ of perception to feel different forms of aether, so the mage’s mind interprets it as a different sensory image such as a smell or a sound. Most mages can utilise all their senses for their Aetherial Perception but have a primary way of perceiving aether, usually sight or hearing.

## Soul Constitution

The soul is a kind of astral body, an ordered structure of stable, dense aether. It is present in all forms of life, including the most primitive. It has a complex structure, and is divided into several Mantles. From four to nine, depending on the creature. Each Mantle has countless names, but here are the most common and simple ones.

### First Mantle

This is a traditional name for the physical body. However, this component is far from necessary - there are quite a few creatures that are not burdened with this shell. These creatures are called spirits.

### Second Mantle

Vital energy, also known as prana, among other names. It permeates every cell of the physical body, allowing the creature to live, breathe, move, feed, reproduce. The complete loss or disintegration of prana means the death of the physical body. If a creature possesses some semblance of a soul and a physical body, but lacks the Second Principle, then what we have is undead. 

### Third Mantle

Astral body, also called Skias Onap. It is visible to some extent - this is what magi perceive, examining an aura. The Third Mantle ensures our afterlife, produces ba-hion and allows us to travel in the immaterial realms. The astral body copies the physical, which is why spirits and ghosts usually look the same as they did in life. It is necessary to radically change the very perception of oneself in order for the astral appearance to undergo a change. Not only people have their own Skias Onap, but also animals, plants, even inanimate beings - very primitive, but still there. That is why there may be ghost ships, ghost houses, ghostly weapons, ghostly clothes ... in fact, almost every material body casts such an "astral shadow". 

### Fourth Mantle

Atman, also known as the True Soul - the central core, the pivot to which all the other Mantles are "attached". This is the most important Mantle - self-awareness. It encodes basic information about the structure of the soul. It is impossible to change or destroy the Fourth Mantle. This is the part of a soul that is responsible for reincarnation.

### Fifth Mantle

Sensual spirit, or Oumos. This is personality, character, emotions, feelings. It is this Mantle that is usually seen as soul in fairy tales - a creature devoid of the Oumos is akin to a soulless machine. Higher animals have rudimentary Oumos as well, for them it sustains their characters as well as instincts, especially more advanced ones.

### Sixth Mantle

Cognitive spirit, or Frenes. This is the mind, memory. This Mantle is concentrated around one's brain. It is thanks to the Frenes that the spirit after death retains the ability to think and remember, despite the loss of the brain. 

### Seventh Mantle

Active spirit, or Nous. These are spiritual lines and nodes, through which mana flows. It is this Mantle that allows you to cast spells and do magic. In ordinary people, the Nous is in a "dormant" state, and only in a properly trained magician does it flourish in all its glory. Of course, even among non-magicians, Nous is present and functioning - it produces ba-hion, such things as prayer, meditation depend on it, Nous also gives you your imagination. Even dreams are one of the manifestations of Nous. 

### Eighth Mantle

Immortal spirit. Only true immortals possess one. In addition to indefinitely long life, this Mantle also grants a number of other benefits. At the very least, this is an increase in physical abilities, not necessarily all at once, but in some form - for sure. As well as all sorts of other properties and characteristics that depend on the specific type of the spirit and on the type of aether it is composed of.

### Ninth Mantle

Divine spirit. Only the gods have this Sheath and is generated through a kind of “opening” or “flowering” of the Atman. It is based on the primary element and determines the polarity of the deity - belonging to the Light or Dark gods. It gives amazing abilities to influence reality but to stabilise this "ethereal vortex" deities require ba-hion supplied by their followers.

## The Tower

The Tower is an organisation of mages created by the Sumerian wizards to control magic usage in the Sumer, teach and develop the Sumerian school of magic, as well as to investigate and confront potentially dangerous supernatural phenomena. Every guest mage who wants to practise the Art at the territory of the empire must get a permit from the Tower and every Sumerian mage-to-be must be a part of the Tower.  
As a Sumerian mage you have countless privileges provided to you by the Tower, such as a community to rely on, political power or repositories of arcane knowledge, but there is a price for all of that, as you have one duty before the Tower, a tax, if you will. To be able to progress in ranks, or benefit from all your privileges you must work for the Tower in some way with your magic or spend money instead, to help sustain the Tower’s existence and the higher your stance is in the Tower the harder are your tasks and the more you have to contribute to the Tower.  
The Tower is autonomous from the rest of the Sumer thus even the Lugal himself can’t command mages directly without giving something to The Tower in return, which raises some tension between mages and the government and aristocracy. This tension can lead to severe consequences, maybe an outright civil war, but the tension is not that high yet and the conflict mostly manifests through a bit of intrigue and plotting from both sides.
