## Character Advancement

### Milestones

In The Adept character advancement is handled with milestones. In bridge scenes or between sessions you can spend XP to increase your traits or unlock other benefits.
- Spend 5 XP to:
    - Unlock an SFX or Limit.
    - Add a d6 Signature Asset or Specialty.
    - Switch out a distinction for a new one.
- Spend 10 XP to:
    - Add a new SFX or Limit.
    - Step a Specialty or Signature Asset up to d8.
    - Add a d6 Power.
- Spend 15 XP to:
    - Step a Specialty or Signature Asset up to d10.
    - Step a Approach or Move up to d6.
    - Step a Power up to d8.
- Spend 20 XP to:
    - Step a Specialty or Signature Asset up to d12.
    - Step a Approach or Move up to d8.
    - Step a Power up to d10.

    - Step a Status up to d8.
- Spend 35 XP to:
    - Step a Status up to d10.
- Spend 40 XP to:
    - Step a Status up to d12.

If you switch out a distinction, your new distinction has as many SFX unlocked as the original, although they may be entirely different SFX.

### Session Records

As an option you may swap Milestones with Session Records. If you choose to do so at the end of each session the GM will work collectively with the players to come up with the name of the session. Players can opt out to write a unique name for the session representing a characterâ€™s experience that session.  
Each player can make a callback to a session they have on their character record by referencing a given session in-character. A session callback can be used as a substitution for using a PP.  
You can make a callback to a previous session only once per session, checking the box next to the record. Uncheck the boxes when a new session begins.  
Once you have made at least one callback to a session during play, it may be spent. By spending sessions from your record, you can make permanent improvements to your Wizard. A spent session remains on the record but can no longer be used for callbacks or to train a second time. During tag scenes, spend sessions to:

- Switch out a distinction for a new one: 1 session.
