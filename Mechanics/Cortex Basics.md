# What do You Need to Play

To play the Adept, one person acts as the Game Moderator. Everyone else is a player. You also need game dice (physical or virtual), a pencil and some paper or a blank character journal (or a tablet or other mobile device) to record your character traits and info, and a supply of game tokens such as poker chips or beads.

# Players

The Adept, as most other tabletop games, works best with two to six players, each one creating and playing their own player character. You record your player character’s statistics and information in a character journal. As a player, you imagine what your character would do; describe their actions, feelings, and experiences; and use the game rules to see if they succeed or fail.

**Players are responsible for:**
- Deciding what their PCs do.
- Confronting any problems that the GM throws in front of them.
- Pointing their PCs in directions that make for good stories.
- Supporting other PCs and giving them a shot at what they’re good at.
- Deciding how their PCs change and grow over time.
- In general, telling the story of their PCs.

Additionally, each player is responsible for helping ensure that the gaming experience is enjoyable for everyone. Consent should always be part of a group’s conversation about social standards at the table. 

See [Consent](/Consent) for more.

# Game Moderators

Game Moderator presents scenes, locations, and Game Moderator characters (GMCs) in the form of an open-ended tale. As the Game Moderator, you give the players fun situations to respond to and use the rules to reveal how their characters interact with the world they’re in.

**As Game Moderator, you are responsible for:**
- Preparing and presenting the tale to the players.
- Acting out the parts of NCs and deciding how they react to the PCs.
- Asking leading questions of the players to lead them into further adventure.
- Revealing the important details of the world to the players.
- Watching over the game rules at the table and managing the pace of the session.
- In general, bringing the world of Xadia to life in the minds of the players.

# Dice

We use five different kinds of dice in the Adept: d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12. The number tells you how many sides the die has; the more sides, the bigger the numbers. A handful of dice together is called a dice pool.

Any time you roll a die, the number you get on the die is called the result. Usually you choose two results to add together to get a total. A third die from your dice pool, called the effect die, might be chosen to show the impact of your success.

Dice are used to resolve tests, contests, crises and challenges. They let you know if your PC succeeds, fails, or turns the story in their favor.

# Traits and Die Ratings

All characters in the Adept, whether they’re PCs or GMCs, are described using game traits. Traits cover a range of descriptive elements, grouped into trait sets. These include approaches, values, distinctions, disciplines, signature assets, and specialties.

Every trait in the game is rated with a die, called a die rating. Whenever you use a trait, you pick up a die of that many sides for your dice pool. In this way, your dice pool is made up of all of the traits that might affect how successful your PC is in doing what you want them to do.

The die rating tells you how much of an effect that trait has on the outcome of any given roll. They’re a useful shorthand for how powerfull, focused, serious, or skilled your character is.

More sides don’t always mean better, so much as they mean more important or significant in the story. Having a d12 in a trait like Focus vs a d12 in a trait like Justice doesn’t mean that focus and attentiveness or valuing justice measure the same things. It just means that being extremely carefull can affect the outcome just as much as being obsessed with justice can.

Here's a quick list of traits you can expect in the Adept:

# Stepping Up and Stepping Down

Sometimes you swap out one or more dice in your dice pool for dice with more or fewer sides. This is called stepping up or stepping down a die rating.

To step up a die by one, swap it for a die that’s one step bigger than the original, like a 6 to a 8. To step down a die by one, swap it out for a die that’s one step smaller, like a d6 to a d4.

Die ratings can only have five possible steps, from d4 to d12. If you step a d12 in a dice pool up by one, it remains at d12, but you can step up another die in your dice pool by one step instead. If you step a d4 down by one, it’s removed from the dice pool.

If you’re asked to step up a d12 that isn’t currently in a dice pool, it remains at d12, but you gain a d6 alongside it. Wherever that d12 goes, the d6 goes with it.
