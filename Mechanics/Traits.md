## Traits

### Approaches

Approaches are a trait that describes how you accomplish a task. They don’t offer insight into characters skills or training, instead representing ways in which characters are more likely to approach a situation.  
Approaches used in the Adept are:
- **Flair**: An action that draws attention to you; it’s full of style and panache. 
- **Focus**: Time-consuming action in which close attention is paid to details so the task is properly executed on the first attempt.
- **Force**: A display of brute strength rather than subtlety.
- **Guile**: An effort focusing on misdirection, stealth, or deceit.
- **Haste**: A dexterous movement with alacrity.
- **Wits**: Quick thinking, solving complex problems, or accounting for numerous variables at once.

Approaches usually have a rating from d6 to d10, although there are exceptions. Everyone has a rating in all of them.  
Approaches scale as follows:
- **d4: Poor**. Notably deficient in this area.
- **d6: Typical**. An average degree of ability.
- **d8: Excellent**. Above-average performance.
- **d10: Remarkable**. Greatly above average.
- **d12: Incredible**. Peak levels of ability.

### Values

Values represent how much specific things matter to the PC and, in turn, how much they influence the outcome of tests and contests. They embody a character's motivatios and morals. A high rating in a value doesn’t mean your character likes or stands out as a paragon of that value, but rather that they are more invested and concerned about that value than if they had it at a lower die rating. A d10 in Truth could still mean the character is a liar, but the concept of truth and falsehood is one of the things that drives them the most to succeed.  
Values used in the Adept are:
- **Devotion**: Duty, faith and friendship.
- **Glory**: Legacy, fame and fortune.
- **Justice**: Fairness, virtue and reward.
- **Liberty**: Freedom and autonomy.
- **Mastery**: Control, achievement, and skill.
- **Truth**: Fidelity, certainty, and authenticity.

Values range from d4 to d12 in rating, although extremes are rare. Everyone has a rating in all of them. Whenewer a value would change - stepping up or down - another should change in the opposite direction. Thus, the total number of die steps in the dice assigned to values should always stay the same.  
Each value has a statement atteched to it, a statement is a sentence or phrase that clarifies or refines the value that it’s attached to.
The die rating of a value measures how much the value matters to the character, as follows:
- **d4** I’m really not into this.
- **d6** Sure, this matters. But so do a lot of things.
- **d8** This is definitely on my radar.
- **d10** I’m all over this thing.
- **d12** This is my heart and soul.

#### Questioning Statements

Whenewer a character acts contrary to their statement in an action they tripple their value rating for one roll.  
Once the statement is questioned the rating of a value it's attached to steps down.
At the end of the session, a player who questioned a statement must either:
- Rewrite the statement to reflect a new belief or truth and return the die to its original rating, or
- Keep the statement the same and the die rating remains stepped down. This may mean stepping up another trait to balance it out.

If a d4 trait is questioned, it is shut down until the end of the session. Its trait statement must be rewritten to return it to a d4 die rating.

### SFX

In The Adept SFX can be applied to your Distinctions, Magic as a trait, Methods of Magic and Status.

### Magic

#### Using aether

When you are casting a spell you are assumed to use mana which inflicts Mana stress on hitches. But you may willingly opt to channel another type of aether to fuel your spells from these options: psi, astral body, emosequence and prana. Because you are untrained in using these forms of aether you suffer stress every time you use these, Body stress for prana, Soul stress for astral body and Mind stress for psi and emosequence. As you advance you may acquire access to other forms of aether or become more proficient in channelling some of the aforementioned ones suffering corresponding stress only on hitches.  
Also you can use Magic through another type of aether even when it is shut down by Out of Mana Limit.

#### Magic SFX

Your Magic trait has following SFX:
> **Out of Mana**: When Drained stress would step past d12, set it to d12 instead and shut down your Magic, step down Drained to recover. Alternatively you can declare that you are out of mana, shut down your Magic for a scene and gain a PP.  
> **Flexible Casting**: Spend a PP and step down effect die to use your discipline as another practice.

#### Methods of Magic

In The Adept magic is divided into five Methods that function like a Power Set with at least one Limit and SFX pertaining to respective Method’s strengths and weaknesses. You can include one die from one of the methods in your rolls.  
The five methods are as follows:

##### Enchantment

Enchantment is based on imbuing items and beings with magical properties. Enchanting is a long process which produces items or beings that either have their own magical properties or help to channel the caster’s own magic. It also often requires special instruments and reagents. Enchantments can last very long, even indefinitely.  
**Time Intensive**: All enchantments take time, thus to create an asset using this method you must spend one scene making it.  
**Lasting Enchantment**: When you spend at least a couple of days to create an asset using this Method it lasts for the entire session.

##### Magical Craftsmanship

Magical Craftsmanship is based on creation and usage of different magical consumables. These consumables can range from magical potions and alchemickal grenades to plant parts with magical properties. Creating each consumable  can be a lengthy process that can only be done in a specially prepared environment, but consumables can be more easily mass-produced and then used by anybody, even a person without any magical training and prowess.  
**Prepared Environment**: You can use this Method when you have access to an appropriate workshop, whether an already existing or one created with tests.  
**Non Fungible Asset**: When you create an asset that can only be used once, step up your effect die.

##### Ritual Magic

Ritual Magic is based on performing lengthy magical ceremonies. Each ritual is essentially a more sophisticated version of a spell, combining multiple mediums and involving the possibility of consumable reagents usage to boost the magical effect. Rituals are much more cumbersome and lengthy to use which is their main weakness. But Rituals can also produce long-term and even permanent effects unlike spells which are usually instant or not long lasting.  
**Preparation**: Using this Method requires lengthy preparation and cannot be performed in the middle of combat.  
**Reagents**: Double all assets consumed as reagents with performing Ritual Magic.

##### Spellcasting

Spellcasting is based on using special techniques called spells. Each spell is essentially a description of a desired effect encoded in its medium, such as spoken words, gestures, inscribed symbols and so on. The main merit of Spellcasting is the sheer versatility of the spells possible, because any mage can cast any spell, provided he knows it. Main drawbacks of Spellcasting are the fact that each spell has a very narrow usage and, because of the absolute length and variety of the spells most mages can’t memorise all of them they have to retain a part of their spells in their mind or to spend a couple of minutes to cast the spell from their references.  
**Exact Spells**: When you declare that you are casting a memorised spell for effects it was not designed for, step down the rating of the Power you are using for one roll and earn a PP.  
**Memorised Spells**: Spend a PP to reveal that you had previously memorised a spell and gain it as a d6 asset for the session.

##### Will Magic

Will Magic is based on channelling mana through the power of mind. Magic can be used via imagination, intellect, willpower, strong emotions, or all of the above. Will Magic is very flexible in its applications, because it is not restricted by any formulas, but very narrow in variety, as controlling magic by force of mind is more difficult than with the usage of niĝdimdima or prepared equipment. Will magic is also the easiest to lose control of because of the aforementioned reasons.  
**Unstable Spells**: Whenever you fail a test involving application of this Method your effect is still enacted but in an uncontrolled fashion and you add your largest die into the Doom Pool.  
**Crude Magic**: Step up or double your power whenever the effect of your magic is not precise or sophisticated. Add your effect die to the Doom Pool.

#### Effects of Magic

Each of the methods has following effects as Powers in set, each power can be bought separately for each Method of Magic.  
The Effects are as follows:
- **Animation**: Magical Effects related to animating inert matter such as corpses, volumes of homogeneous matter or manufactured statues and mechanisms.
- **Chaos Manipulation**: Magical Effects related to influencing the probabilities, bestoving good and bad luck.
- **Elemental Magic**: Magical Effects related to creating and manipulating a given element. Choose one element when purchasing this Effect (Pyromancy, Hydromancy, etc.), this Effect can be bought multiple times choosing a different element each time.
- **Extraordinary Senses**: Magical Effects related to enhancing your senses and gaining new ones.
- **Flesh Manipulation**: Magical Effects related to transforming physical bodies and healing.
- **Hyperinteractions**: Magical Effects related to travelling between and interacting with the Seven Spheres.
- **Illusion**: Magical Effects related to deceiving senses, magical disguise, phantasms.
- **Materialisation**: Magical Effects related to transforming aether into matter essentially creating it from nothing.
- **Matter Transformation**: Magical Effects related to transforming matter both in form and composition.
- **Mental Manipulation**: Magical Effects related to manipulating the minds emotions and instincts and programing mental constructs.
- **Metamagic**: Magical Effects related to absorbing reforming all sorts of aetheric forces not bound to matter, such as antimagic or tampering with spells already cast.
- **Portals & Teleportation**: Magical Effects related to creating portals or teleporting between different points in space either in one reality or between different ones.
- **Soul Manipulation**: Magical Effects related to manipulation of soul composition and functions.
- **Space Manipulation**: Magical Effects related to warping spatial geometry and scaling as well as creating unusual spatial phenomena.
- **Summoning**: Magical Effects related to summoning and banishing extraplanar beings such as demons, celestials, all kinds of spirits and even gods.
- **Telekinesis & Levitation**: Magical Effects related to moving objects and controlling kinetic forces.
- **Time Manipulation**: Magical Effects related to accelerating or decelerating time and warping its flow.

### Hero Dice

Every time you get a heroic success you can store the opposition’s highest rolling die on your character sheet. You can have only one hero die of each size, otherwise they function as stated in the Handbook.

### Stress & Trauma

Stress and trauma are a measure of your damage. There are six types of stress and trauma in the Adept:
Drained: This is the stress of mana depletion. Once this exceeds d12, you are drained of mana and can’t cast even the simplest spell.
- **Exhausted**: This is the stress of fatigue and tiredness. Once this exceeds d12, you can no longer remain awake.
- **Injured**: This is the stress of pain and wounding. Once this exceeds d12, you collapse unconscious, or aren’t able to act because of pain.
- **Rattled**: This is the stress of fear, anxiety and insecurity. Once this exceeds d12, you are paralysed by fear and insecurity.
- **Shattered**: This is the stress of spiritual damage. Once this exceeds d12, your Mantles are shut down and can’t function temporarily.
- **Unsound**: This is the stress of confusion and madness. Once this exceeds d12, you are overcome with madness or confusion.

### Complications

A complication is an unhelpful temporary trait that the opposition includes in their dice pool to make the opposed roll harder for the character with the complication. Complications should be given descriptive names and a die rating, usually a d6 to start.

#### Using Complications

Whenever a player or the GM is rolling against a character that has a relevant complication, they may add it to their dice pool. Doing so doesn’t cost anything, and there’s no limit to how many applicable complications can be included in a dice pool, nor is there a limit on how many complications a character can have.

#### Complications As Consequence

Outside of hitches, complications can arise as a result of a lost contest or failed test. In either situation, the GM can decide that a player must step up an existing complication by one if the existing complication is equal to or larger than the die rating of the new complication.

### Dropping Signature Assets

At any point during the scene a player can choose to lose a Signature Asset narratively justifying it. If you do this, at the start of the next scene you can gain a new Signature Asset of the same size or multiple Signature Assets with ratings stepped down for each after the first.
