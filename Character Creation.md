## Character Building

### Step 0: Get resources

Grab a copy of this character sheet or this template for Fari.

### Step 1: Choose Distinctions

Choose three Distinctions narratively representing your character. These distinctions are Upbringing, High Concept and Character Trait (Trouble). Your Upbringing and Character Trait (Trouble) are rated at d8, High Concept at d6.  
Write two additional SFX for each Distinction, after that unlock two SFX on any Distinction.  
Each of your distinctions benefits from the Hinder SFX:  
> **Hinder**: Roll a d4 instead of your rating for a distinction to earn a PP.

### Step 2: Assign Approaches

Assign eleven steps between approaches, each one starting at d4. Quick pick: d10, d10, d8, d8, d6, d4, or d10, d8, d8, d8, d6, d6.

### Step 3: Assign Values

Assign nine steps between values, each one starting at d4. No value may be greater than d10. Quick pick: d10, d8, d8, d6, d6, d4.

### Step 4: Assign Methods and Effects

You have 9 steps to spend on these options:
- One step to buy a d6 Effect;
- Two steps to buy a d8 Effect;
- Four steps to buy a d10 Effect;
- Two steps to buy a new SFX or Limit for one of Methods in which you have at least one Effect.

### Step 5: Assign Specialties and Signature Assets

Players have 6 steps to spend on these options:
- One step to buy a d6 Signature Asset;
- Two steps to buy a d8 Signature Asset;
