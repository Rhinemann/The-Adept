# The Rules

### Doom Pool

Doom Pool is used in the same way as written in Cortex Handbook, but as Adept is designed with long term games in mind it is advised that after every major arc the GM should reset or otherwise weaken it to ease the tension and represent the reducing threat.  
The doom pool can be used for additional scene effects, depending on the game. Some of the most common uses are:
- **Create a complication, asset, or scene distinction**: spend a die from the doom pool and create a Complication or Asset attached to the scene equal in size to the die spent. Or, spend at least a d8 and add a distinction to the scene that may be used by players and GMCs alike.
- **Add a new extra**: Spend a die from the doom pool and create an extra with a single trait rated at the size of the doom die spent.
- **Introduce a minor or major GMC**: If a GMC who isn’t present in the scene could conceivably show up, spend a die from the doom pool equal to that GMC’s highest rated trait and drop them into the scene, ready to act when the action order gets to them (which could be right away, if the GM is the one deciding who goes next).
- **Split the group**: spend a d10 or a d12 from the doom pool and some environmental or narrative event takes place that divides the group into two (minimum one PC in each new group). The PCs have to spend time reuniting their group, which may lead to more problems.
- **End the scene immediately**: spend 2d12 from the doom pool and cut the scene off right there before it’s resolved, with the GM deciding how it ends. Usually, the scenes should play out until there’s a reasonable ending point, but this way the GM can just smash cut to a new scene with plot threads dangling. Or stage an auto-win by the villains.

### Crisis Pools

Crisis Pools represent localised problems, smaller in scale than general Doom Pool.
To form a Crisis Pool a GM should spend dice from his Doom Pool. Dice spent this way transfer directly from Doom Pool into a Crisis Pool, reducing an overall session threat. When transferring dice from Doom Pool to a Crisis Pool a GM can split a die into two dice, stepped down by one  or combine two dice into one and step it up.  
Crisis pools can be directly affected by the actions of PCs. In this way, they are a lot like mobs. To eliminate a die in a crisis pool, a player makes a test opposed by the crisis pool. If they beat the crisis pool’s difficulty, they can apply an effect die of at least one step larger to the crisis die they want to get rid of. This takes it out of the crisis pool entirely. If they don’t have a die that’s larger, they can use one of the same size or smaller to step down a crisis die instead. Crisis pools reduced to zero dice are no longer problems.

### Challenges

Challenges are a mod of crisis pools. Challenges represent problems that are many-faceted, presenting different, smaller issues to tackle before being fully resolved, or problems that are big or take a lot of time.  
Challenges take place over several rounds. Each round represents some passage of time; it could be a few seconds, or it could be hours or even days. The challenge gets to act on its own turn and can either get worse or create problems for the PCs in response.  
If there’s no time-sensitive element to the challenge, success becomes a matter of how long it takes the players to overcome the challenge without getting taken out of the scene. The GM may declare that something happens after a certain number of rounds; if this happens, the PCs have failed the challenge.

#### Challenge Pool

A challenge pool is a dice pool that represents the difficulty and duration of a challenge; it’s rolled by the GM to set the difficulty for each PC’s turn, and for the GM to roll against the PCs on the challenge pool’s turn.
To create a challenge pool, the GM chooses base difficulty dice the same way as they would in a test. Then, they add up to 3 additional dice of the same die rating depending on how long the challenge should take to overcome.

#### Taking Turns In A Challenge

Challenges use handoff initiative. The GM decides which PC goes first, but once a PC has had their turn, that player chooses which remaining PC goes next. Each player gets one turn per round. On a PC’s turn, the GM rolls the challenge pool to set the difficulty, just like in a test.
Once every PC has had a turn, the challenge pool acts.  
The GM can choose to either:
- Target a player with a negative effect, or
- Strengthen the challenge pool by stepping up one of its dice or adding a d6.

If the GM targets a PC, their player rolls to set a difficulty for the challenge pool first, and the GM rolls the challenge pool second, giving the PC stress (or a complication) on a success.  
Once the GM has had their turn, it’s back to the players. The player who went last in the previous round gets to choose who goes first, including nominating themselves.

#### Challenge Outcomes

If a PC beats the challenge difficulty on their turn, they make progress, and compare their effect die to one of the dice in the challenge pool. If it’s bigger, the challenge die is removed from the challenge pool. If it’s equal to or smaller, the challenge die is stepped down by one step. If a challenge die would be reduced below d4, it’s taken out of the pool.  
If the PC doesn’t beat the difficulty, they fail to progress the challenge, and take stress (or a complication) of the GM’s choice equal to the challenge pool’s effect die.  
A heroic success in a challenge lets a PC overcome it faster. Each heroic success lets them step up their effect die by one step, or keep an additional effect die from their remaining dice; with the latter, they can compare this added effect die to another die in the challenge pool and either eliminate it or step it down, as well. See Heroic Success.  
Once the challenge pool is reduced to zero dice, the challenge is over, and the PCs have won. Alternatively, the GM may declare that something happens after a certain number of rounds. If this happens, the challenge may be a failure if players don’t overcome the challenge in time.

### Doom vs Crisis vs Challenge

Doom pools, crisis pools, and challenge pools share similar mechanics, but they represent different kinds of opposition.  
A doom pool is an overarching threat that dominates the setting. It serves as the opposition for all tests and can aid major GMCs. The doom pool grows larger and smaller in the size and number of the dice that make it up, but it’s never completely eliminated. Dice from the doom pool can be spent to do the same things as PP, in addition to a variety of other actions.  
Crisis pools are a mod of doom pools that represent smaller localised problems. There are often several crisis pools at a time, pulling the attention of the PCs in various directions. A crisis pool can spend its dice much like a doom pool, but only for things related to the crisis. The PCs can directly affect and eventually eliminate crisis pools.  
You can use both crisis pools and the doom pool, spending dice directly from the doom pool to create a new crisis pool.  
Dice spent in this manner go from the doom pool to the crisis pool, thus reducing the overall doom of the session but creating specific, localised situations the players can directly affect.  
A challenge pool is a mod of crisis pools that represents a single multi-faceted problem that the PCs can directly affect and eventually eliminate. Unlike a crisis pool or doom pool, the challenge pool cannot spend dice as if they were PP.

## Game Master Characters

### Bosses

A boss is a type of GMC that might represent a powerful opponent like a huge rampaging monster, or it may be a foe who outclasses the PCs not only in traits, but in an abstract dramatic sense. Bosses can replace major GMCs in your games if you prefer not to do all the work of making opponents who have the same game stats as your PCs.

#### Creating A Boss

Rather than a full character file, a boss has multiple dice of one size that make up a boss trait, such as 4d10. They can also have distinctions, SFX, or anything else the GM wants to add in. The dice pool for a boss typically consists of large and/or many dice.

#### Defeating A Boss

A boss is defeated when all of their boss trait dice are removed. Each time the outcome of a PC’s roll would create or step up a complication or stress that exceeds the boss trait die rating, one die is knocked off, and the complication or stress is removed. When all of the boss trait dice are eliminated, the boss is defeated.
