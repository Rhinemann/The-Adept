# The Rules

## Traits

### Approaches

Approaches are a trait that describes how you accomplish a task. They don’t offer insight into characters skills or training, instead representing ways in which characters are more likely to approach a situation.  
There are six approaches:
- **Flair**: An action that draws attention to you; it’s full of style and panache. 
- **Focus**: Time-consuming action in which close attention is paid to details so the task is properly executed on the first attempt.
- **Force**: A display of brute strength rather than subtlety.
- **Guile**: An effort focusing on misdirection, stealth, or deceit.
- **Haste**: A dexterous movement with alacrity.
- **Wits**: Quick thinking, solving complex problems, or accounting for numerous variables at once.

#### Rating Approaches

Approaches usually have a rating from d6 to d10, although there are exceptions. Everyone has a rating in all of them.  
Approaches scale as follows:
- **d4: Poor**. Notably deficient in this area.
- **d6: Typical**. An average degree of ability.
- **d8: Excellent**. Above-average performance.
- **d10: Remarkable**. Greatly above average.
- **d12: Incredible**. Peak levels of ability.

### Moves

Moves are a trait that describes what course of action you take approaching a task. Moves represent more general experience of a character and their preferred way of problem solving.  
There are six moves:
- **Assess**: Planning and gathering information.
- **Defend**: Keeping someone or something from harm.
- **Engage**: Confronting a threat or situation directly.
- **Influence**: Exerting your will on others.
- **Support**: Healing or otherwise offering aid.
- **Unleash**: Throwing caution to the wind.

#### Rating Moves

Moves usually have a rating from d6 to d10, although there are exceptions. Everyone has a rating in all of them.  
Moves scale as follows:
- **d4: Poor**. Notably deficient in this area.
- **d6: Typical**. An average degree of ability.
- **d8: Excellent**. Above-average performance.
- **d10: Remarkable**. Greatly above average.
- **d12: Incredible**. Peak levels of ability.

### SFX

In The Adept SFX can be applied to your Distinctions, Magic as a trait, Methods of Magic and Status.

### Magic

#### Using aether

When you are casting a spell you are assumed to use mana which inflicts Mana stress on hitches. But you may willingly opt to channel another type of aether to fuel your spells from these options: psi, astral body, emosequence and prana. Because you are untrained in using these forms of aether you suffer stress every time you use these, Body stress for prana, Soul stress for astral body and Mind stress for psi and emosequence. As you advance you may acquire access to other forms of aether or become more proficient in channelling some of the aforementioned ones suffering corresponding stress only on hitches.  
Also you can use Magic through another type of aether even when it is shut down by Out of Mana Limit.

#### Out of Mana

Your Magic trait has a following SFX:
> **Out of Mana**; When Drained stress would step past d12, set it to d12 instead and shut down your Magic, step down Drained to recover. Alternatively you can declare that you are out of mana, shut down your Magic for a scene and gain a PP.

#### Methods of Magic

In The Adept magic is divided into five Methods that function like a Power Set with at least one Limit and SFX pertaining to respective Method’s strengths and weaknesses. You can include one die from one of the methods in your rolls.  
The five methods are as follows:

##### Enchantment

Enchantment is based on imbuing items and beings with magical properties. Enchanting is a long process which produces items or beings that either have their own magical properties or help to channel the caster’s own magic. It also often requires special instruments and reagents. Enchantments can last very long, even indefinitely.  
**Time Intensive**: All enchantments take time, thus to create an asset using this method you must spend one scene making it.  
**Lasting Enchantment**: When you spend at least a couple of days to create an asset using this Method it lasts for the entire session.

##### Magical Craftsmanship

Magical Craftsmanship is based on creation and usage of different magical consumables. These consumables can range from magical potions and alchemickal grenades to plant parts with magical properties. Creating each consumable  can be a lengthy process that can only be done in a specially prepared environment, but consumables can be more easily mass-produced and then used by anybody, even a person without any magical training and prowess.  
**Prepared Environment**: You can use this Method when you have access to an appropriate workshop, whether an already existing or one created with tests.  
**Non Fungible Asset**: When you create an asset that can only be used once, step up your effect die.

##### Ritual Magic

Ritual Magic is based on performing lengthy magical ceremonies. Each ritual is essentially a more sophisticated version of a spell, combining multiple mediums and involving the possibility of consumable reagents usage to boost the magical effect. Rituals are much more cumbersome and lengthy to use which is their main weakness. But Rituals can also produce long-term and even permanent effects unlike spells which are usually instant or not long lasting.
Limit: Preparation. Using this Method requires lengthy preparation and cannot be performed in the middle of combat.
SFX: Reagents. Double all assets consumed as reagents with performing Ritual Magic.
Spellcasting
Spellcasting is based on using special techniques called spells. Each spell is essentially a description of a desired effect encoded in its medium, such as spoken words, gestures, inscribed symbols and so on. The main merit of Spellcasting is the sheer versatility of the spells possible, because any mage can cast any spell, provided he knows it. Main drawbacks of Spellcasting are the fact that each spell has a very narrow usage and, because of the absolute length and variety of the spells most mages can’t memorise all of them they have to retain a part of their spells in their mind or to spend a couple of minutes to cast the spell from their references.
Limit: Exact Spells. When you declare that you are casting a memorised spell for effects it was not designed for, step down the rating of the Power you are using for one roll and earn a PP.
SFX: Memorised Spells. Spend a PP to reveal that you had previously memorised a spell and gain it as a d6 asset for the session.
Will Magic
Will Magic is based on channelling mana through the power of mind. Magic can be used via imagination, intellect, willpower, strong emotions, or all of the above. Will Magic is very flexible in its applications, because it is not restricted by any formulas, but very narrow in variety, as controlling magic by force of mind is more difficult than with the usage of niĝdimdima or prepared equipment. Will magic is also the easiest to lose control of because of the aforementioned reasons.
Limit: Unstable Spells. Whenever you fail a test involving application of this Method your effect is still enacted but in an uncontrolled fashion and you add your largest die into the Doom Pool.
SFX: Crude Magic. Step up or double your power whenever the effect of your magic is not precise or sophisticated. Add your effect die to the Doom Pool.
Effects of Magic
Each of the methods has following effects as Powers in set, each power can be bought separately for each Method of Magic.
The Effects are as follows:
Animation: Magical Effects related to animating inert matter such as corpses, volumes of homogeneous matter or manufactured statues and mechanisms.
Chaos Manipulation: Magical Effects related to influencing the probabilities, bestoving good and bad luck.
Elemental Magic: Magical Effects related to creating and manipulating a given element. Choose one element when purchasing this Effect (Pyromancy, Hydromancy, etc.), this Effect can be bought multiple times choosing a different element each time.
Extraordinary Senses: Magical Effects related to enhancing your senses and gaining new ones.
Flesh Manipulation: Magical Effects related to transforming physical bodies and healing.
Hyperinteractions: Magical Effects related to travelling between and interacting with the Seven Spheres.
Illusion: Magical Effects related to deceiving senses, magical disguise, phantasms.
Materialisation: Magical Effects related to transforming aether into matter essentially creating it from nothing.
Matter Transformation: Magical Effects related to transforming matter both in form and composition.
Mental Manipulation: Magical Effects related to manipulating the minds emotions and instincts and programing mental constructs.
Metamagic: Magical Effects related to absorbing reforming all sorts of aetheric forces not bound to matter, such as antimagic or tampering with spells already cast.
Portals & Teleportation: Magical Effects related to creating portals or teleporting between different points in space either in one reality or between different ones.
Soul Manipulation: Magical Effects related to manipulation of soul composition and functions.
Space Manipulation: Magical Effects related to warping spatial geometry and scaling as well as creating unusual spatial phenomena.
Summoning: Magical Effects related to summoning and banishing extraplanar beings such as demons, celestials, all kinds of spirits and even gods.
Telekinesis & Levitation: Magical Effects related to moving objects and controlling kinetic forces.
Time Manipulation: Magical Effects related to accelerating or decelerating time and warping its flow.
Status
All mages of the Tower are a part of hierarchy, ruled by the council of archmages. Their status determines their influence on the Tower’s and Empires politics as well as approximately represents their magical power.
In The Adept your High Concept Distinction is rated from d6 to d12 and it represents your stance in Tower’s hierarchy.
When you are using magic, no matter which Distinction you are using, GM may decide that you are using magic outside of your league, compare your High Concept to what the GM has set as spell’s power, for each step above your High Concept you must replace the biggest die in your pool with d4.
d4: Student. A mage in training, they are not considered full members of the Tower yet.
d6: Apprentice. A novice, but already trained mage, who has just finished their magical studies.
d8: Master. An experienced mage, who is adept enough to create their own magical technique from scratch.
d10: Magister. A very powerful mage, who has presented a completely new discovery to the Tower.
d12: Archmage. An incredibly powerful mage who is a paragon of human magician, this title is elected by the archmage council of the Tower.
Hero Dice
Every time you get a heroic success you can store the opposition’s highest rolling die on your character sheet. You can have only one hero die of each size, otherwise they function as stated in the Handbook.
Stress & Trauma
Stress and trauma are a measure of your damage. There are six types of stress and trauma in the Adept:
Drained: This is the stress of mana depletion. Once this exceeds d12, you are drained of mana and can’t cast even the simplest spell.
Exhausted:  This is the stress of fatigue and tiredness. Once this exceeds d12, you can no longer remain awake.
Injured: This is the stress of pain and wounding. Once this exceeds d12, you collapse unconscious, or aren’t able to act because of pain.
Rattled: This is the stress of fear, anxiety and insecurity.. Once this exceeds d12, you are paralysed by fear and insecurity.
Shattered: This is the stress of spiritual damage. Once this exceeds d12, your Mantles are shut down and can’t function temporarily.
Unsound: This is the stress of confusion and madness. Once this exceeds d12, you are overcome with madness or confusion.
Complications
A complication is an unhelpful temporary trait that the opposition includes in their dice pool to make the opposed roll harder for the character with the complication. Complications should be given descriptive names and a die rating, usually a d6 to start.
Using Complications
Whenever a player or the GM is rolling against a character that has a relevant complication, they may add it to their dice pool. Doing so doesn’t cost anything, and there’s no limit to how many applicable complications can be included in a dice pool, nor is there a limit on how many complications a character can have.
Complications As Consequence
Outside of hitches, complications can arise as a result of a lost contest or failed test. In either situation, the GM can decide that a player must step up an existing complication by one if the existing complication is equal to or larger than the die rating of the new complication.
Doom Pool
Doom Pool is used in the same way as written in Cortex Handbook, but as Adept is designed with long term games in mind it is advised that after every major arc the GM should reset or otherwise weaken it to ease the tension and represent the reducing threat.
The doom pool can be used for additional scene effects, depending on the game. Some of the most common uses are:
Create a complication, asset, or scene distinction: spend a die from the doom pool and create a Complication or Asset attached to the scene equal in size to the die spent. Or, spend at least a d8 and add a distinction to the scene that may be used by players and GMCs alike.
Interrupt the action order: Spend a die from the doom pool equal to or greater in size than the largest combat or senses-related trait of the PC whose turn is up next. One of the GM’s own GMCs gets to go instead, and the GM then picks who goes afterward (not necessarily the player who was interrupted).
Add a new extra: Spend a die from the doom pool and create an extra with a single trait rated at the size of the doom die spent.
Introduce a minor or major GMC: If a GMC who isn’t present in the scene could conceivably show up, spend a die from the doom pool equal to that GMC’s highest rated trait and drop them into the scene, ready to act when the action order gets to them (which could be right away, if the GM is the one deciding who goes next).
Split the group: spend a d10 or a d12 from the doom pool and some environmental or narrative event takes place that divides the group into two (minimum one PC in each new group). The PCs have to spend time reuniting their group, which may lead to more problems.
End the scene immediately: spend 2d12 from the doom pool and cut the scene off right there before it’s resolved, with the GM deciding how it ends. Usually, the scenes should play out until there’s a reasonable ending point, but this way the GM can just smash cut to a new scene with plot threads dangling. Or stage an auto-win by the villains.
Crisis Pools
Crisis Pools represent localised problems, smaller in scale than general Doom Pool.
To form a Crisis Pool a GM should spend dice from his Doom Pool. Dice spent this way transfer directly from Doom Pool into a Crisis Pool, reducing an overall session threat. When transferring dice from Doom Pool to a Crisis Pool a GM can split a die into two dice, stepped down by one  or combine two dice into one and step it up.
Crisis pools can be directly affected by the actions of PCs. In this way, they are a lot like mobs. To eliminate a die in a crisis pool, a player makes a test opposed by the crisis pool. If they beat the crisis pool’s difficulty, they can apply an effect die of at least one step larger to the crisis die they want to get rid of. This takes it out of the crisis pool entirely. If they don’t have a die that’s larger, they can use one of the same size or smaller to step down a crisis die instead. Crisis pools reduced to zero dice are no longer problems.
Challenges
Challenges are a mod of crisis pools. Challenges represent problems that are many-faceted, presenting different, smaller issues to tackle before being fully resolved, or problems that are big or take a lot of time.
Challenges take place over several rounds. Each round represents some passage of time; it could be a few seconds, or it could be hours or even days. The challenge gets to act on its own turn and can either get worse or create problems for the PCs in response.
If there’s no time-sensitive element to the challenge, success becomes a matter of how long it takes the players to overcome the challenge without getting taken out of the scene. The GM may declare that something happens after a certain number of rounds; if this happens, the PCs have failed the challenge.
Challenge Pool
A challenge pool is a dice pool that represents the difficulty and duration of a challenge; it’s rolled by the GM to set the difficulty for each PC’s turn, and for the GM to roll against the PCs on the challenge pool’s turn.
To create a challenge pool, the GM chooses base difficulty dice the same way as they would in a test. Then, they add up to 3 additional dice of the same die rating depending on how long the challenge should take to overcome.
Taking Turns In A Challenge
Challenges use handoff initiative. The GM decides which PC goes first, but once a PC has had their turn, that player chooses which remaining PC goes next. Each player gets one turn per round. On a PC’s turn, the GM rolls the challenge pool to set the difficulty, just like in a test.
Once every PC has had a turn, the challenge pool acts.
The GM can choose to either:
Target a player with a negative effect, or
Strengthen the challenge pool by stepping up one of its dice or adding a d6.
If the GM targets a PC, their player rolls to set a difficulty for the challenge pool first, and the GM rolls the challenge pool second, giving the PC stress (or a complication) on a success.
Once the GM has had their turn, it’s back to the players. The player who went last in the previous round gets to choose who goes first, including nominating themselves.
Challenge Outcomes
If a PC beats the challenge difficulty on their turn, they make progress, and compare their effect die to one of the dice in the challenge pool. If it’s bigger, the challenge die is removed from the challenge pool. If it’s equal to or smaller, the challenge die is stepped down by one step. If a challenge die would be reduced below d4, it’s taken out of the pool.
If the PC doesn’t beat the difficulty, they fail to progress the challenge, and take stress (or a complication) of the GM’s choice equal to the challenge pool’s effect die.
A heroic success in a challenge lets a PC overcome it faster. Each heroic success lets them step up their effect die by one step, or keep an additional effect die from their remaining dice; with the latter, they can compare this added effect die to another die in the challenge pool and either eliminate it or step it down, as well. See Heroic Success.
Once the challenge pool is reduced to zero dice, the challenge is over, and the PCs have won. Alternatively, the GM may declare that something happens after a certain number of rounds. If this happens, the challenge may be a failure if players don’t overcome the challenge in time.
Doom vs Crisis vs Challenge
Doom pools, crisis pools, and challenge pools share similar mechanics, but they represent different kinds of opposition.
A doom pool is an overarching threat that dominates the setting. It serves as the opposition for all tests and can aid major GMCs. The doom pool grows larger and smaller in the size and number of the dice that make it up, but it’s never completely eliminated. Dice from the doom pool can be spent to do the same things as PP, in addition to a variety of other actions.
Crisis pools are a mod of doom pools that represent smaller localised problems. There are often several crisis pools at a time, pulling the attention of the PCs in various directions. A crisis pool can spend its dice much like a doom pool, but only for things related to the crisis. The PCs can directly affect and eventually eliminate crisis pools.
You can use both crisis pools and the doom pool, spending dice directly from the doom pool to create a new crisis pool.
Dice spent in this manner go from the doom pool to the crisis pool, thus reducing the overall doom of the session but creating specific, localised situations the players can directly affect.
A challenge pool is a mod of crisis pools that represents a single multi-faceted problem that the PCs can directly affect and eventually eliminate. Unlike a crisis pool or doom pool, the challenge pool cannot spend dice as if they were PP.
Dropping Signature Assets
At any point during the scene a player can choose to lose a Signature Asset narratively justifying it. If you do this, at the start of the next scene you can gain a new Signature Asset of the same size or multiple Signature Assets with ratings stepped down for each after the first.
Character Advancement
Milestones
In The Adept character advancement is handled with milestones. In bridge scenes or between sessions you can spend XP to increase your traits or unlock other benefits.

If you switch out a distinction, your new distinction has as many SFX unlocked as the original, although they may be entirely different SFX.
Session Records
As an option you may swap Milestones with Session Records. If you choose to do so at the end of each session the GM will work collectively with the players to come up with the name of the session. Players can opt out to write a unique name for the session representing a character’s experience that session.
Each player can make a callback to a session they have on their character record by referencing a given session in-character. A session callback can be used as a substitution for using a PP.
You can make a callback to a previous session only once per session, checking the box next to the record. Uncheck the boxes when a new session begins.
Once you have made at least one callback to a session during play, it may be spent. By spending sessions from your record, you can make permanent improvements to your Wizard. A spent session remains on the record but can no longer be used for callbacks or to train a second time. During tag scenes, spend sessions to:
Switch out a distinction for a new one: 1 session.
Unlock or add a new SFX: 2 sessions.

Turn an asset from a session into a d6 Signature Asset: 1 session.
Step a Signature Asset up to a d8 : 2 sessions.

If you switch out a distinction, your new distinction has as many SFX unlocked as the original, although they may be entirely different SFX.
Game Master Characters
Bosses
A boss is a type of GMC that might represent a powerful opponent like a huge rampaging monster, or it may be a foe who outclasses the PCs not only in traits, but in an abstract dramatic sense. Bosses can replace major GMCs in your games if you prefer not to do all the work of making opponents who have the same game stats as your PCs.
Creating A Boss
Rather than a full character file, a boss has multiple dice of one size that make up a boss trait, such as 4d10. They can also have distinctions, SFX, or anything else the GM wants to add in. The dice pool for a boss typically consists of large and/or many dice.
Defeating A Boss
A boss is defeated when all of their boss trait dice are removed. Each time the outcome of a PC’s roll would create or step up a complication or stress that exceeds the boss trait die rating, one die is knocked off, and the complication or stress is removed. When all of the boss trait dice are eliminated, the boss is defeated.
